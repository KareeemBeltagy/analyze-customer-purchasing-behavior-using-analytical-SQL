# Online Retail Dataset Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze the Online Retail dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) model.

## Dataset

The Online Retail dataset contains transactional data for an online retail store from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011. It consists of columns such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.

## Analysis

The following SQL queries will be used to gain insights from the dataset:

1. Total revenue generated by each country
2. Most popular product by quantity sold
3. Monthly revenue trend over the year
4. Distribution of customers by RFM scores
5. Customer retention rate over time

## RFM Segmentation

Based on the RFM model, customers will be segmented into the following groups:

1. Champions
2. Loyal Customers
3. Potential Loyalists
4. Recent Customers
5. Promising
6. Customers Needing Attention
7. At Risk
8. Cant Lose Them
9. Hibernating
10. Lost

RFM scores will be calculated for each customer and then used to segment them into the appropriate group based on their scores. To reduce the number of permutations, we will take the average scores of frequency and monetary.

## Daily Purchasing Transactions Analysis

We are also provided with a daily purchasing transactions dataset for customers. The following two questions will be answered using this dataset:

1. What is the maximum number of consecutive days a customer made purchases?
2. On average, how many days/transactions does it take a customer to reach a spent threshold of 250 L.E?

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, insights into customer behavior will be gained, and recommendations will be provided to increase sales/revenue, improve customer retention, and decrease churn.
